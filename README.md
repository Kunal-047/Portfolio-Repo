# Portfolio-Repo
A 12-month roadmap and collection of practical Python projects focused on web scraping, data cleaning, automation, and simple machine learning tools for small businesses.

# Freelance Python Portfolio (12-Month Roadmap)

This repository documents my journey building practical, real-world Python projects focused on automation, data extraction, data cleaning, and simple machine learning tools for small businesses.

The goal of this portfolio is not academic projects, but **sellable micro-products** and **client-ready scripts** that solve common business problems.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

Over the next 12 months, I will build projects in the following areas:

- Web scraping & data extraction
- Data cleaning and transformation (CSV, Excel)
- Automation scripts (scheduled jobs, reporting)
- Simple data analysis & visualization
- Basic machine learning prediction APIs
- Lightweight dashboards and internal tools

All projects will be written with clarity, documentation, and real-world usability in mind.

## 🗺️ Planned Projects Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundations & Micro-Products
**Timeline:** Month 1

- **Product Price Scraper**
  - Python script to scrape product prices from e-commerce websites
  - Outputs clean CSV files
  - Designed as a “weekly price tracker” for sellers

- **Data Cleaning Templates**
  - Reusable Python/Jupyter templates for cleaning messy CSV files
  - Handles missing values, duplicates, formatting issues
  - Generates a short summary report

---

### Phase 2 — Automation & Simple Apps
**Timeline:** Months 2–3

- **Automated Reporting Script**
  - Scheduled Python job (cron)
  - Extracts data, cleans it, and emails CSV reports weekly

- **Data Cleaning Web App**
  - Upload CSV → automatic cleaning → download cleaned file
  - Built using Streamlit or Flask

---

### Phase 3 — ETL & Predictive Models
**Timeline:** Months 4–6

- **CSV-to-SQL ETL Pipeline**
  - Ingests CSV data into a SQL database
  - Performs basic transformations and validations

- **Predictive Baseline Model**
  - Simple supervised ML model using scikit-learn
  - Includes metrics, sample predictions, and API endpoint

---

### Phase 4 — Client-Ready Systems
**Timeline:** Months 7–12

- **Predictive Model API**
  - REST API using FastAPI
  - Containerized with Docker
  - Returns predictions from trained models

- **Freelance Scripts Library**
  - Collection of reusable, documented scripts for client work
  - Includes logging, error handling, and configuration examples

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

Planned stack includes:

- Python
- pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup
- scikit-learn
- FastAPI / Flask / Streamlit
- SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL basics)
- Git & GitHub
- Docker (basic usage)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each project will live in its own repository with:
  - Clear README
  - Setup & usage instructions
  - Sample data and outputs
- This portfolio is a living document and will evolve as projects are completed.
